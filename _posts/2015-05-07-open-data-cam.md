Earlier
[today](http://www.data.cam.ac.uk/events/open-data-lunchtime-session-central-cambridge-0),
I attended an information session about Open Data presented by Marta
Teperek from the
[Research data management](http://www.data.cam.ac.uk/) team
([@CamOpenData](https://twitter.com/CamOpenData)) at the University of
Cambridge.

Marta talked about the EPSRC open data policy. These policies are
currently the strictest among the UK research councils and it is
expected that other research councils will align their requirements to
the EPSRC. Other than the respective funding bodies sites, useful
links to learn about these policies are the
[Research Data Management](http://www.data.cam.ac.uk/research-data-policies/funders-policies)
and the [sherpa/juliet](http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/juliet/) sites. The
[Cambridge Open Access](https://www.openaccess.cam.ac.uk/) initiative
was also mentioned, and how they support researcher in publishing
their work under an open access license. Marta also described the
[DMPonline](https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/), a tool that assists
researchers to produce an effective data management plan. We were also
informed that the University provided a
[data repository](http://www.data.cam.ac.uk/data-repository) that
would store any reasonable sized data for a (reasonable, I think) cost
of Â£5/GB. This is a one-off payments to store the data according to
funders regulations, i.e. 10 years since the last access (which means
that of somebody accesses your data after 9 years and 11 months, the
timer is set to zero for another 10 years again). Marta made it
however very clear that this was certainly not meant to replace well
established academic domain-specific data repositories. During the
question session, open source software was mentioned and I was very
happy to hear that Marta advised to get in touch with the
[Software Sustainability Institute](http://software.ac.uk/).

For more details, see the

The information that was communicated was very relevant and spot on,
as reflected by from the interest and questions from the audience. In
the future, I would however like to see the promotion of open data and
open access for their own benefits, rather than as a result of funders
policies, i.e. develop a bottom-up culture of Openness rather than a
top-down approach. For that, it would be great to involve some key
persons in the Open data/access/research communities, such as
[Erin McKiernan](https://twitter.com/emckiernan13),
[Ross Mounce](https://twitter.com/rmounce),
[Mike Taylor](https://twitter.com/MikeTaylor) or
[Peter Murray-Rust](https://twitter.com/petermurrayrust) (who is
local, by the way) and many others. These people are in a position to
inspire researchers, especially younger ones. I also think that it
would be beneficial to involve researcher that are active in the open
data and data sharing trenches in these more formal local open data
initiatives and to provide a domain-specific as well as more technical
input.

In general, while I certainly support the Research data management
initiative, I think open data/resarch/access should be a
community-wide effort and the main actors should be involved as much
as possible.

I would like to conclude with the following suggestion. If the
emphasis of openness in scholar activities should primarily be the
inherent benefits and moral value of openness in research and
education (rather than compliance to policies), there really should be
an effort to educate students in open scholarship. When will there be
open scholarship course in our Universities' curricula?


**Edit**:

* 2015-05-12 Tue: I would like to crowd-source material and
  references to set up a core curriculum for open scholarship: what is
  open access, why do we want open science, what are the benefits or
  free open source software, ... Want to contribute of follow the
  progress? See this [google doc](https://goo.gl/wifsTE) or the
  [github repository](https://github.com/lgatto/open-scholarship-curriculum/).
