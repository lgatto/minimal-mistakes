Following up from the
[Quantitative Proteomics and Data Analysis](https://www.biochemistry.org/Events/tabid/379/View/Programme/MeetingNo/TD007/Default.aspx)
course, where in animated a discussion table about *Inspection,
visualisation and analysis of quantitative proteomics data*
(introductory [slides](http://bit.ly/qprotda) and
[vignette](http://bit.ly/qprotdavig)), I wrote a few pieces of advice
about data analysis. These are written for bio-sciences students and
researchers who perform experiments and would like to analyse their
data themselves, they are generally applicable to anyone who collects
or plans to collect and want to analyse them.

## Plan ahead

Learn about data analysis, the software or programming language you
want to use/learn, how experts in your field analyse similar data, and
try to practice and talk about data analysis before to actually do the
work. Just as one can't expect to start running with a marathon, don't
expect to analyse a non-trivial dataset from scratch without any prior
practice.

## Factor in analysis time

Data analysis takes time. Factor that in from the very beginning. I
have seen too many situations were the paper/thesis had to be
submitted really soon and people started to think about how to
actually identify the most meaningful results from the data, or were
still battling with conflicting advice from colleagues.

You won't start your day at work with a good cup of coffee/tea, sit in
front of your computer, cracked on with your data analysis and return
home with all the results you expected. It will take time, multiple
attempts and some amount of trial and error before you'll consider it
done.

## Analyse early, analyse often

Ideally, data analysis will begin as soon as the first data is
produced. Don't wait for the full dataset to be ready. At that point,
chances are that you will be expected to deliver results.

Data analysis will also inform on important properties or biases in the
data, which you would want to know about as early as possible. At the
end, it is often too late to consider re-running some experiments or
adding replicates.

## Divide and conquer

Data analysis should be deconstructed in a series of mini-analyses
before and after which you visualise the data and effect of whatever
operation (normalisation, filtering, ...) you have applied to the
data. You can't expect the analyses to be performed in one single big
step, i.e. feed it into a big box (whether it is closed or wide open
for you to look inside) and get an acceptable result at the end. The
data and questions to be solved are generally too complex for this to
work. 

When decomposing the analysis in multiple steps, you'll realise that
often there are multiple ways to solve a sub-question, and it is not
always obvious which one is the best. To help yourself make
appropriate decision for *your* data, visualise it, check the
downstream effects of your decision, and don't forget what your
overall goal/question is. It is surprisingly easy to get sidetracked
in tiny optimisations that only have a very minor influence on the
final results and end up being overwhelmed by accidental (as opposed
to essential/genuine) complexity (as described
[here](http://shaffner.us/cs/papers/tarpit.pdf]]) for development of
large-scale software system, but also applied to large data
analysis). Make sure you understand what matters most (in terms of
results and analyses decisions). 

Sometimes, there won't be any obvious *better way*; in that case, go
for the easiest, most trackeable solution, or ask for advice/help from
a experienced analyst, who most likely has already stumbled on that
question.

## Ask for help

Better late than never, but much better early on. It is very unlikely
that your data and analysis is completely new and that there's nobody
that, either has already done that kind of analysis, or has the right
experience to be helpful. Ask around, or on mailing lists and
forums. But make sure you first do your homework, i.e. think about the
problem and try to solve it.
