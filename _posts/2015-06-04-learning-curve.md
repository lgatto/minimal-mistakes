title: The steep learning curve

TL;DR The bloody steep learning curve is just a silly excuse and will
only result in keeping [computer|programming|stats|...] literacy low
in life sciences. Stop using it.

## Introduction

It is not uncommon to read statements as the following after praising
to benefits of a powerful programmatic environment for data analysis
such as python, R, MATLAB and friends:

> However, one substantial disadvantage of
> [insert aforementioned software] is the steep learning curve before
> most biologists can take full advantage of the features they offer.

## The rant

And while it is undeniable that there is a learning curve, I find it
quite disheartening how the steepness of the curve is taken as an
excuse for not learning what is unmistakably an essential requirement
for modern biology. Does that mean that one should not to invest time
in what takes efforts despite the confessed undeniable advantage? The
goal is not to become an expert programmer, but learn enough to
understand and apply basic concepts, gain independence when it comes
to simple data analysis and communicate with one's computational
colleagues.

In [this paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23692960), I have
attempted to offer a more considered view

My point here is not the (silly) GUI vs CLI debate (that's for another
post), but here is the relevant part in the same reference.

## Equivalent for computational biologists

What would the equivalent computational biologist's and
bioinformatician's steep learning be? Would you trust a
bioinformatician that finds it too difficult to learn about RNA-Seq
protocols or basics of mass spectrometry?

## Education

A solution is, of course, better education. How can we demystify
programming - is it perceived as something that you are good at or
not? Probably. I have [Software](http://software-carpentry.org/),
[Data Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org/) and many other
efforts. Not only do these teach important skills to the attendees,
but they also contribute to a change of mentalities.
