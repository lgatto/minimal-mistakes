## git and svn

Github and `git` and really nice and despite `git`'s additional
complexity, my preferred solutions for a few years now. Nevertheless,
subversion is still around and much used. Since some projects are
hosted by third parties using svn, but I still want to use Github, I
tried to initialise `git` and checkout `svn` in the same
directory. This hybrid versioning solution, which keeps the two
version controllers completely independent, seems to work quite
well. The only little tweaks are to ignore the respective `.git` and
`.svn` directories. The latter in easy with the `.gitignore`
file. Ignoring files in `svn` is not that straightforward. One needs
to set [properties](http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch07s02.html)
on the files/dirs to be ignores and, what was confusing to me,
`commit` these to the server. Here are three posts
[[1](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/116074/how-to-ignore-a-directory-with-svn),
[2](http://blog.bogojoker.com/2008/07/command-line-svnignore-a-file/),
[3](http://www.math-linux.com/spip.php?article110)] that helped me to
realise how to this and will hopefully prove helpful next time I have
to repeat this.

## git-svn

This is obviously the sophisticated solution, that enable to merge and
preserve the respective commit message. These
[[1](http://ivanz.com/2009/01/15/selective-import-of-svn-branches-into-a-gitgit-svn-repository/),
[2](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/296975/how-do-i-tell-git-svn-about-a-remote-branch-created-after-i-fetched-the-repo)]
were the most helpful resources. There is also of course the
[Pro Git book](http://git-scm.com/book) with a `git-svn`
[section](http://git-scm.com/book/ch8-1.html). This documentation was
migrated to the Bioconductor `BiocGithubHelp`
[wiki page](https://github.com/Bioconductor/BiocGithubHelp/wiki/Managing-your-Bioc-code-on-hedgehog-and-github).

## Bitbucket to Github migration

Moving code from [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/lgatto) to
[Github](https://github.com/lgatto) is straightforward. But there is
much more than just code in such a project. In my case, I had issues I
really wanted to preserve, and I could not find any easy way to do it
(as of the time of writing). There were scripts to migrate issues and
bug tracking between different providers, but not exactly what I
needed. Had to read about the respective APIs to do it manually, which
was not too difficult. Briefly, here is a summary of what I did, more
or less:

1. Download issues locally as described
   [here](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Issues). The
   issues need to be public, though.

          curl https://api.bitbucket.org/1.0/repositories/:user/:repo/issues/1/ > myissue1.json


   (where `:user` and `repo` are my/your user and repository names
   respectively).

2. Unfortunately, the `json` issues are not compatible: Bitbucket's
   `content` is called `body` by Github (there might be more...). A
   bit of `perl` magic did the trick here.

          perl -pi -e 's/\"content\":/\"body\":/' issue*.json

3. Post the issues on Github following the
   [API docs](http://superuser.com/questions/149329/what-is-the-curl-command-line-syntax-to-do-a-post-request):

          curl -u ":user:password" -X POST -d @issue1.json ttps://api.github.com/repos/:user/:repo/issues

It is far from perfect; comment were missing! Fortunately, there were
only very few issues with relevant comments (most closing comments
were _fixed in version x.y.z_), so I did not dig deeper. The above
steps were embedded in a short shell script to automate the 30ish
issues to be moved. Hope that next time I need to do this, somebody
will have a great script ready, or at least this will prove helpful.
